# Two-view Geometry - Camera Rotation about a center

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on detection and matching of features between two images taken by a camera rotated by a certain angle about its center. As the feature matching algorithm includes many noisy features, outlier rejection is also implemented to determine an accurate set of inliers. This is followed by a linear estimation of 2D projective transformation matrix for the camera using the set of inliers. This estimate is further refined through non-linear estimation using the Lavenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The images of the results obtained are shown below.
